# Microservices
Microservices is a software architecture style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, loosely coupled services, each focusing on a specific business capability, communicating via APIs, and deployable separately, offering agility, scalability, and easier maintenance compared to monolithic apps, though it introduces complexity in management. Each service has its own codebase, data, and dependencies, allowing small teams to develop and update them quickly without affecting the entire system, making them ideal for cloud-native development.
